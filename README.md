Resume Parsing System 

Resumes come in many formats, which makes it difficult for recruiters and automated tools to extract consistent information. 
This project aims to solve that challenge by building an NLP-driven resume parser capable of converting unstructured resume text into clean, structured data.
The system extracts key fields such as:
Name
Email
Phone Number
Skills
Education
Experience

Dataset Description:
Resumes:- A collection of PDF resumes with different layouts, styles, and structures.
Ground Truth (ground_truth.json):- This file contains manually labeled fields for each resume, including:
Name
Email
Phone Number
Skills
Education
Experience
The ground truth enables field-wise performance comparison between predicted outputs and actual labels.
